# arduino-projects

this is a collection of projects i've started while playing with an Arduino Uno for my 12th grade Engineering and Design class.

## aerial-imaging
we were tasked with writing a program that can accomplish the following tasks:

* read data from a BMP180 barometer and calculate the height
* deliver a payload once a certain height has been reached with a servo motor
* signal that the circuit has reached aforementioned height (this is what the LED does)
* read data from an SR04 ultrasonic sensor and detect if the circuit has reached the ground
* signal that the sircuit has fallen back down to the ground (this is what the piezo does)

## ghost fight / once-upon-a-time / spider-dance

recreation of the songs [Ghost Fight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zz1bfhtKsHM), [Once Upon A Time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7RRgF5Ve_E), and [Spider Dance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ3XjVVNagU) from the video game [UNDERTALE](http://undertale.com/).

they all play on a piezo.
